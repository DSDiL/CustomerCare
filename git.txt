Thanks.

dear madam,
            I am 3rd year 1st semester student specializing in software engineering. I was drafted to group WD.SE.07.G2 which has physical lectures in 2nd week. I am hoping to change my group to a group that has physical lectures in 1st week because all my other project group members are from those groups.
           So, I am kindly requesting to change my group to either WD.SE.06.1.G1 or WD.SE.06.2.G1 or WD.SE.07.G1, which will be a huge help for our project works.
Thank you.
